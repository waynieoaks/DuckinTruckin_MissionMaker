# Duckin Truckin [Mission Maker] for GTA 5
A series of trucking missions for use with Mission Maker for GTA 5. 

## About: ##
This is a series of trucking missions that I have put together using the Mission Maker mod for GTA 5. Some are recreated from the original [Trucking Missions](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/trucking-missions) mod.

While I like the Trucking Missions mod, I missed being able to use custom or add on trucks for the missions. I also wanted to develop some missions using add on trailer packs which I plan do do in the future if people are interested in this. 

You can pick one of the three available trucks or spawn in your own if using add on trucks. The timer will start when you leave the compound and stop when you deliver the trailer. You can then drive back to the compound at your own leasure.  

Timings for the missions is based on following traffic laws. 

I recommend the following mods to add to the realism: 
 
1. [Pull me over](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/pull-me-over-0-8) 
2. [I Surrender](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/i-surrender)
3. [LeFix Simple Fuel mod](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/lefix-simple-fuel) or other preferred fuel mod.

## Installation: ##
Make sure you have ScripthookV and ScripthookV.Net installed and have Mission Maker installed and working. 
Then copy the missions folder into the MissionMaker folder. 
Feel free to edit to suit your requirements, including adjusting the mission timers or removing the final drive back to the compound.  

## Current Missions: ##

* **001 The Clucking Bell:** Recreated from the original Trucking Missions mod. Pickup a Clucking Bell trailer from Grapeseed and deliver it to the factory in Paleto Bay. (Credit, Guadmaz)
* **002 Clucking Bell 2:** A spin on the original Clucking Bell mission, collect from a different farm in Grapeseed.
* **003 Clucking Bell 3:** A spin on the original Clucking Bell mission, collect from farm near the grain silos on Union Lane.
* **004 Revenge of the Clucking Bell:** Head into the city at night to collect some special ingredients from the Coroner's Office

### More missions coming soon ###
I am looking to develop more missions as time allows. If you have any great ideas for missions, share them by raising an issue. 

## Known issues: ##

1. You can drive off without dropping trailer. This is a limit with MissionMaker.
2. You do not get paid like you do with Trucking Missions, again this is a limit of the MissionMaker mod.
